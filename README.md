# Hooked

 A movie search interface

## Description

Hooked is a movie search UI that allows a user to fetch a list of movies from OMDB database.
This project was based off of a [freeCodeCamp](https://www-freecodecamp-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-movie-search-app-using-react-hooks-24eb72ddfaf7/amp/) challenge.
However Hooked was created entirely by me using only `CRA`, `useState` and `useEffect` plus my own styling (making it responsive and using SASS).  
For this challenge the API only return ten search results.
